# Ethical Hacking Learning Path

## Introduction
- **Definition of Ethical Hacking**: Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, is the practice of intentionally probing computer systems, networks, and applications to identify security vulnerabilities.

- **Importance of Ethical Hacking**: Ethical hackers help organizations identify and rectify security weaknesses, protecting them from cyber threats. Their work is crucial in maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.

- **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Understanding the legal and ethical boundaries of ethical hacking is essential. This includes complying with laws and respecting privacy.

## Prerequisites
- **Basics of Computer Networking**: Resources such as Cisco's [Introduction to Networking](https://www.netacad.com/courses/intro-net) can help you understand networking fundamentals.

- **Knowledge of Operating Systems**: Familiarize yourself with both Linux and Windows operating systems through resources like the [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) and [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/).

- **Programming and Scripting Skills**: Learn Python for ethical hacking using resources like [Codecademy's Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3).

- **Cybersecurity Fundamentals**: Explore cybersecurity basics through the [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/) platform.
